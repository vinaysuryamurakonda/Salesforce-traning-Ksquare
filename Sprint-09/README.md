# 🚀 Sprint 8 – Asynchronous Apex (Future, Queueable, Batch & Scheduled Apex)

## 📖 Overview

Sprint 8 focuses on **Asynchronous Apex**, which allows Salesforce to execute long-running operations in the background without making users wait. This sprint demonstrates how to build scalable and efficient asynchronous solutions using **Future Methods, Queueable Apex, Batch Apex, Scheduled Apex**, and **Queueable Chaining**.

# 🎯 Learning Objectives

After completing this sprint, I learned to:

- Understand synchronous and asynchronous processing.
- Identify which operations should execute immediately and which should run in the background.
- Implement Future Methods.
- Create Queueable Apex jobs.
- Chain Queueable jobs.
- Process large datasets using Batch Apex.
- Schedule jobs using Scheduled Apex.
- Combine Scheduled Apex with Batch Apex.
- Monitor asynchronous jobs using AsyncApexJob.
- Understand Idempotency.
- Understand Batch Size selection.

# ✅ Task 1 – Transaction Boundary (Theory)

## Objective

Identify which operations should execute synchronously and asynchronously.

### Synchronous Operations

- Validate Offer
- Update Offer
- Update Student
- Return Confirmation

### Asynchronous Operations

- External System Synchronization
- Notification Processing
- Analytics Processing

### Learning Outcome

Learned to separate immediate business logic from background processing before selecting an asynchronous Apex mechanism.

---

# ✅ Task 2 – Queueable Apex

## Apex Class

```
OfferPostProcessingJob.cls
```

## Objective

Execute post-offer processing asynchronously using Queueable Apex.

## Execute Anonymous

```apex
Id dummyOfferId = '001000000000001AAA';

System.enqueueJob(
    new OfferPostProcessingJob(dummyOfferId)
);
```

## Concepts Learned

- Queueable Interface
- QueueableContext
- execute() Method
- System.enqueueJob()

## Verification

- Setup → Apex Jobs
- Status = Completed

---

# ✅ Task 3 – Future Method

## Apex Class

```
OfferFutureHandler.cls
```

## Objective

Execute background processing using Future Methods.

## Execute Anonymous

```apex
Id dummyOfferId = '001000000000001AAA';

OfferFutureHandler.processOfferAsync(dummyOfferId);
```

## Concepts Learned

- @future Annotation
- Static Future Methods
- Legacy Asynchronous Apex

## Verification

- Apex Jobs
- Debug Logs

---

# ✅ Task 4 – Queueable Chaining

## Apex Classes

```
ExternalPlacementSyncJob.cls
PlacementNotificationJob.cls
```

## Workflow

```
ExternalPlacementSyncJob
        ↓
PlacementNotificationJob
```

## Execute Anonymous

```apex
Id dummyOfferId = '001000000000001AAA';

System.enqueueJob(
    new ExternalPlacementSyncJob(dummyOfferId)
);
```

## Concepts Learned

- Queueable Chaining
- Single Responsibility Principle
- Background Workflow Design

---

# ✅ Task 5 – Idempotency (Theory)

## Objective

Understand duplicate execution of asynchronous jobs.

## Topics Covered

- Duplicate execution
- Duplicate notifications
- Duplicate analytics
- Duplicate external records
- Synchronization status
- Transaction reference
- Existing record validation

## Learning Outcome

Understood how idempotency prevents duplicate business outcomes when asynchronous jobs are retried.

---

# ✅ Task 6 – Batch Apex

## Apex Class

```
VehicleBatchProcessor.cls
```

## Objective

Process large datasets efficiently using Batch Apex.

## Methods Implemented

- start()
- execute()
- finish()

## Execute Anonymous

```apex
Database.executeBatch(
    new VehicleBatchProcessor(),
    5
);
```

## Verification

- Setup → Apex Jobs
- Status = Completed

---

# ✅ Task 7 – Batch Size Selection (Theory)

## Topics Covered

- CPU Usage
- Heap Usage
- SOQL Queries
- DML Operations
- Business Logic Complexity

## Learning Outcome

Learned that the ideal batch size depends on processing complexity rather than using a fixed value.

---

# ✅ Task 8 – Scheduled Apex

## Apex Class

```
VehicleScheduler.cls
```

## Objective

Execute Apex automatically at a scheduled time.

## Execute Anonymous

```apex
String cronExp = '0 0 10 * * ?';

System.schedule(
    'Vehicle Daily Scheduler',
    cronExp,
    new VehicleScheduler()
);
```

## Verification

- Setup → Scheduled Jobs
- Vehicle Daily Scheduler created successfully

---

# ✅ Task 9 – Scheduled Apex + Batch Apex

## Apex Class

```
VehicleBatchScheduler.cls
```

## Objective

Automatically start a Batch Apex job using Scheduled Apex.

## Execute Anonymous

```apex
String cronExp = '0 0 10 * * ?';

System.schedule(
    'Vehicle Batch Scheduler',
    cronExp,
    new VehicleBatchScheduler()
);
```

## Workflow

```
Scheduled Apex
        ↓
VehicleBatchProcessor
        ↓
start()
        ↓
execute()
        ↓
finish()
```

## Learning Outcome

Learned how Scheduled Apex and Batch Apex work together to automate large-volume processing.

---

# ✅ Task 10 – Monitoring Asynchronous Jobs

## Standard Object

```
AsyncApexJob
```

## Objective

Monitor asynchronous Apex jobs.

## Sample SOQL Query

```apex
List<AsyncApexJob> jobs = [
    SELECT Id,
           JobType,
           Status,
           NumberOfErrors,
           JobItemsProcessed,
           TotalJobItems,
           CreatedDate
    FROM AsyncApexJob
    ORDER BY CreatedDate DESC
];

for(AsyncApexJob job : jobs) {

    System.debug('Job Id : ' + job.Id);
    System.debug('Job Type : ' + job.JobType);
    System.debug('Status : ' + job.Status);
    System.debug('Processed : ' +
                 job.JobItemsProcessed + '/' +
                 job.TotalJobItems);
    System.debug('Errors : ' + job.NumberOfErrors);
